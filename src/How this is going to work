lets have the following:
engine
ui
welcomescreen
--each of the above will be in different subdirectories

1. engine subderectories
engine/people
    --will contain abstract person// refactor to just person
engine/buildings
    --will contain abstract bulding
engine/planet
    -- will have grid, planet, country, hazard/resouce/continent
engine/human constructs//needs better name
    -- will have mony source
engine/tools/spacecraft
    --will contain sspacecraft class and offshoots
engine/tools/vehicles/roadgoing
    --will contain vehecles for normal operations in city
engine/tools/vehicles/air
    --aircraft but not spacecraft
engine/tools/vehicles/sea
    --seacraft
engine/tools/vechiles/land
    --tanks etc
engine/tools/weapons/space
    --weapons for space use
engine/science/
    --clasees for differnt discoveries
engine/constants management//need better name
    //how is this going too work??
    //each class could be registerd and updated based on technology
    //a science would list what types and how it would affect them
    //could also contain a lot of interfaces so that science can affecct everuythin of the apropriate type
    //every construcctor would have to register here
engine/random generation
    // not actually a package but would be a random generation class in every subdirectory for this
engine/ai/mayor
    // everything a moayor needs to do to control a city
    //would extend the abstract person in question and do all tasks 
engine/ai/ruler
    //same as mayor but top level
engine/ai/
    // misc as listed above
engine/misc
    //misc stuff
    
more random ideas:
abstract person would have a defualt task that do defualt task would be. use abstract mthod
non abstract method for reasigning tasks -- forces me to still provide some kind of type getter





make a location class insteead of the mess that currently exsists
