distance could be decided on a cityBlock equals 1 basis that seems like a reasonable standard will adopt and some point but not now.












places where constants are needed:
	cost of objects
	weight of objects
	max people on vehicle
	damage done by weapon
	resistance
	start health

variable names:
	cost of objects - c
	weight of objects - w
	max people on vehicle - p
	damage done by weapon - d
	resistance - r
	start health - h
	


h and r should be decided such that neither can destry each other easily

d should be determined based on types and h and r

p should be determined based on max weight capacity and size

should also be a universal constants price








usefulness is the keyword
